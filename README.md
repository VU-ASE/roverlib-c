**When building a service that runs on the Rover and should interface the ASE framework, you will most likely want to use a [roverlib](https://ase.vu.nl/docs/framework/glossary/roverlib). This is the variant for C.**

## Initialize a C service

You can initialize a service with the C roverlib using `roverctl` as follows:

```bash
roverctl service init c --name c-example-service --source github.com/author/example-service-service
```

Read more about using `roverctl` to initialize services [here](https://ase.vu.nl/docs/framework/Software/rover/roverctl/usage#initialize-a-service).

Some code is generated using quicktype, which relies on joelguittet/c-list and joelguittet/c-hashtable. 
These libraries are redistributed in this repository and modified slightly to allow for compilation to static libraries.
